# Base class for visualization component

Provide the ComponentBase class, extending the standard HTMLElement class.

This class provide some useful method and a standard common grounds between components. It also provide way to transparently serialize and deserialize object property to HTML attributes.

### Static event handling

Components deriving from ComponentBase can have some event handling defined in their html attribute **handlers**.
When instantiating the component, new event listener will automatically be added from the handlers defined this way.

#### Understanding handlers

The structure of a generic handler is one of the following :

 - **eventname** ":" **pointer** "->" **functionpath** "(" **arguments** ")"
 - **eventname** ":" **pointer** "->" **propertypath** "=" **argument** 

The first handler is interpreted as : "When the event **eventname** is fired call the function **functionpath** with arguments **arguments** on all nodes matching **pointer**". The second as  "When the event **eventname** is fired assigne the property **propertypath** of all nodes matching **pointer** to the value of **argument** "

**pointer** can either be "this", in which case, the function will be called on the node firing the event or a css selector. In the second case the function will be called on all nodes of the document matching the selector.

**functionpath** and **propertypath** Is either the name of a property of the pointed nodes or a hierarchical path to this function. 
For example a component with the handler ```click : #mycollection -> children[0].remove()``` will remove the first child node of any element with id "mycollection" when clicked.

**argument(s)** argument can either be a static string of a static number or a reference to a value. Reference can be accessed as they would in normal javascript, using dots and brackets. The scope for references contain the handler's component as **this**, the pointed element as **pointed**, the event as **event** and all the properties of event.detail.
